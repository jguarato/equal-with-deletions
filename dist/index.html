<h1>Equal with Deletions</h1>

<p>A prompt from <a href="https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/5-time-moves-slowly-but-passes-quickly-alice/">Cassidy Williams' newsletter</a>: "Given two strings n and m, return true if they are equal when both are entered into text editors. But: a # means a backspace character (deleting backwards), and a % means a delete character (deleting forwards)."</p>
