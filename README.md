## Equal with Deletions Challenge

* A Pen created on CodePen.io for the <strong>#CodePenChallenge: Equal with Deletions</strong>;
* The challenge was to write a function that determines if two strings are equal with deletions in two directions: a # means a backspace character (deleting backwards), and a % means a delete character (deleting forwards). 
* So, for example, the function should find that the strings "pine####apple" and "%%%%pineapple" are equal with deletions: both strings read as "apple" after the backspace deletions are performed in the first string, and the forward deletions are performed in the second string.
